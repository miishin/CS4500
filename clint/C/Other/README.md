The program assumes input from a file, so should be run:

./xyes < filename.json

Only one test was placed into Test/ as the homework page says: 

"Create single test for xjson in the directory Test/"

But additional tests were placed into Other/

test.sh will run all the tests (including the one in Test/)


make build
will build the executable in the C directory (C/xjson)

make run 
will run the test.sh script
