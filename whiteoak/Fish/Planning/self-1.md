## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?


	We mention a client component that AI players will use to communicate with the game server in paragraph 	#4 ("Client").	


  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games


	We mention managing games in the server component (5th paragraph in system.pdf) but do not explicitly 	name a referee object. 


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components


	We skirt around this idea but never address it directly (we mention keeping track of games and player 	lists but none of the real logic behind assigning and managing players).


- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games


	Milestone #3 mentions allowing for the running of local games. 


  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 


	There is no mention of running tournaments on a single computer (locally, and not on the server). 


  - for running remote tournaments on a network

	
	Our final milestone (milestone #5) mentions this. 



- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?


	Each paragraph is dedicated to a single topic, but the GUI paragraph does not start with a clear 	statement. The second sentence is closer to a thesis statement, so it should have gone first with 
	some minor editing. 


  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?


	Most sentences in both documents are short and to the point.


  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?


	For the components, the MVC type components connect, but do not connect to the client-server component 	paragraphs.


  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?

	
	Some sentences in milestones are not complete sentences, and are more like bullet points. 
	For example, the first sentence in milestone 3. 


  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)


	All spelling should be fine. 


The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
