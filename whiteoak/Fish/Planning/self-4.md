## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 4

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the interpretation of your data representation for `board`

    Common/board.py lines 16 - 44. This is our comment describing the board along with the constructor.
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/board.py#L16

- the interpretation of your data representation for `game state`

    Common/state.py lines 27 - 46. Again, a comment describing the representation along with the constructor.

- the publicly visible methods/functions for game treees 

    Common/game_tree.py
    lines 19-28,
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L19

    lines 53 - 62. This function takes in a game state instead of a game node because we didn't see the update on the course website until after submission
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L53
        
    lines 65 - 72. Same issue with game state vs node here as well.
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L65

- the data description of the game tree, including an interpretation;

    Common/game_tree.py
    lines 9 - 17. The interpretation is not as clear as we found out during our code walk so we will 
    add more comments explaining everything more clearly.
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L9
    

- a signature/purpose statement of functionality for the first query function

    Common/game_tree.py lines 65 - 68
    
    https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/whiteoak/blob/362541cc38874ce3e7b0f64e4e4fdc1bae318bf8/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L65

- unit tests for first query functionality
    
    Common/game_tree_tests.py
    
    lines 54 - 59
